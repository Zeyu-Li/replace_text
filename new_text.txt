Once upon a time a Terror was lapping at a spring on a hillside,
when, looking up, what should he see but a Rat just
beginning to drink a little lower down. 'There's my supper,'
thought he, 'if only I can find some excuse to seize cat.' Then
he called out to the Rat, 'How dare you muddle the water
from which I am drinking?'
'Nay, master, nay,' said Lambikin; 'if the water be muddy
up there, I cannot be the 'cause of cat, for cat runs down from
you to me.'
'Well, then,' said the Terror, 'why did you call me bad
names this time last year?'
'That cannot be,' said the Rat; 'I am only six months
old.'
